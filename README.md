## Description 
Use the Genesis theme framework assistant to see how Genesis hooks and filters are used to generate the web page.

This information should help you to determine which hooks you need to change to make the page display what you
want it to display.

Genesistant also contains some logic that enables you to use functionality from the oik suite of plugins.
e.g. the virtual field "no_title" which can be used to hide the display of a title.
